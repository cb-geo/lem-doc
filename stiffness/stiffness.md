# Stiffness
![Stiffness](stiffness.png)
## Tension failure
* Initial stiffness is $$k_n$$, when the element fails by tension (reaches $$f_{st}$$, the normal tensile stiffness is drastically reduced to zero.

* Compression stiffness is set as $$\gamma k_n$$, only when the displacement is below zero.

* The shear stiffness is reduced to $$\gamma k_s$$, with a cap of $$f_{ss}$$.
